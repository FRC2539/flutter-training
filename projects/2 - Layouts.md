## Project #1 - Layouts App

### Project Creation

Follow the steps below to create your first Flutter project.

1. Create a new Flutter project called __Layouts__.

1. To create your Hello World application, you want to modify the file lib/main.dart.  Replace the contents of the main.dart file with the code below.

```
import "package:flutter/material.dart";

void main() {
  runApp(const MaterialApp(
    title: 'Simple Layouts',
    home: Home(),
  ));
}

class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  const Home({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      color: Colors.deepOrangeAccent,
      width: 192.0,
      height: 96.0,
      child: const Text(
        "Team2539",
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 35),
      )
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run the application.  You should see a deep orange screen with the text __Team2539__ (red with a yellow underline) centered in the screen container.

    <img src="images/p2-t1.png" width=25% height=25% />


#### Observations

- Some widgets will inherit a minimum and maximum size from its parent widget.  Even though the __Container__ widget has a width and height defined, the container's size fills the screen due to the minimum width/height values inherited from the MaterialApp widget.


### Challenge

Use the class documentation to assist you in completing the tasks below.

- [Container Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)
- [Center Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html)

The following tasks will ask you to modify the appearence of the container and the __Team2539__ text.  

1. Modify the size of the container to have a width of 192.0 and height of 96.0 while keeping the text centered in the screen.

    <img src="images/p2-t2-1.png" width=25% height=25% />

2. Modify the size of the container to have margins of 50.0 on all sides of the container.

    <img src="images/p2-t2-2.png" width=25% height=25% />

3. Modify the size of the container to have margins of 50.0 on left and right sides of the container.

    <img src="images/p2-t2-3.png" width=25% height=25% />


#### Advanced

You will find these items a bit more challenging.  Use the class documentation to assist you in completing these tasks.

- [Rows Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html)
- [Columns Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html)
- [Expanded Widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html)

1. Starting with the original program for project 2 ...
    - Create two __Text__ widgets next to each other.
    - Set the text for the left widget to be _Margherita_ that is colored black and has size 25.
    - Set the text for the right widget to be _Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil_ that is colored black and has size 20.


    <img src="images/p2-t3-1.png" width=25% height=25% />

2. Adding onto previous project ...
    - Create two __Text__ widgets that are below the existing Text widgets.
    - Set the text for the left widget to be _Marinara_ that is colored black and has size 25.
    - Set the text for the right widget to be _Tomato, Garlic_ that is colored block and has size 20.
    - __Note:__ _You will notice that your text is no longer centered on the screen._


    <img src="images/p2-t3-2.png" width=25% height=25% />

3. Adding onto previous project ...
    - Move the text widgets down the screen by 50.0 and to the left by 15.0.

## Project #4 - Simple Calculator Working App

### Project Creation

Follow the steps below to create your first Flutter project.

1. You will want to use your project 3 solution as a starting point for this application.


### Challenge

The challenge is to bring your simple calculator to life.  Your calculator needs to behave
in the following manner.

1. When a user clicks on "CE", only the current value is to be zero'ed out.

2. When a user clicks on "C", both the current and previous values are to be zero'ed out
   and any saved operations should be reset.

3. When a user clicks on "+/-", you want to change the current value to positive or 
   negative; opposite of the current value.

4. All operators should work as expected and your calculator should be able to support the
   following button sequence "9 x 6 - 3 =" produces a result of "51".

5. Clicking on the "=" symbol completes the operations and resets 

6. The largest number should be 8 characters in length.

7. When a user clicks on a button, it should change color.

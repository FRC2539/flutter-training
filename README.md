## Part 1 - Required Software

Team 2539 decided a few years ago to develop our scouting app in Flutter, an open source framework by Google for building natively compiled and multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

The following is a list of development tools you will need in order to develop in Flutter ...

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    - Download and install
    - Start Android Studio and go through the setup wizard.
    - From the SDK Manager, make sure you install the command-line tools and the Google USB Driver (Windows Only)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - Download and install 
    - Add the extensions for Flutter and Dart
    - Some common confugration options
        -   Custom themes
        -   Coloring bracket pairs (), [], {}
            -   Search in VSCode settings for this option and enable it
        -   Setting a default terminal
            -   Again, search in settings to change it
            -   Press Ctrl/Cmd + J to toggle it

    _Note:  You want to download the latest version of VS Code.  If you have already downloaded the 
    custom VS Code for robot coding, it's recommended that you download the latest standard version
    and install next to the custom version.

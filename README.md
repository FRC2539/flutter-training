## Part 1 - Installing Software

_(Skip this part if you are working with one of the team laptops)_

To program FRC robots in Java, a custom build of Visual Studio Code is required.

Follow the instructions on the [wpilib website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) in order to install this software.

Once WPILIB VSCode is installed, you are ready to go, unless you want to configure VSCode further.

#### Configuring VSCode

Some common configuration options include:

-   Custom themes (I personally recommend Atom One Dark)
-   Coloring bracket pairs (), [], {}
    -   Search in VSCode settings for this option and enable it
-   Setting a default terminal
    -   Again, search in settings to change it
    -   Press Ctrl/Cmd + J to toggle it

Lastly, I highly recommend learning VSCode shortcuts, as they can dramatically speed up your workflow (just look it up on google, there are a million articles).

## Part 2 - Learning Flutter

For learning Flutter, there are a couple of recommended free tutorial sites:

- [Flutter Developers Tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/tutorials)
- [Geeks For Geeks Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flutter-tutorial/)
- [Flutter Campus Tutorial](https://www.fluttercampus.com/tutorials/)
